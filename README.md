# JEOPARDY! by Team Saturated Sidewalks

## Roster
* Peihua Huang : Project Manager
* Alice Ni : Frontend/APIs
* Jacob Olin : Databases
* Hilary Zen : Python

## Description
Our project allows users to create their own Jeopardy boards or use randomly generated ones (with data from APIs) and play. Users' game history will be stored, along with the boards that they create. They can also search for boards that other users created. Each game can have up to 5 teams and scores will be tallied at the bottom of the jeopardy board. Go wild and have fun!
